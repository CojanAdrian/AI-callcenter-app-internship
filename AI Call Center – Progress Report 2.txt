 Overview (Month 2)
During the second month, we expanded the prototype into a more advanced AI call automation system.
We added multilingual support, improved accuracy, upgraded the backend pipeline, and introduced analytics.

Main objective:
Transform the prototype into a stable, data-driven, multilingual AI call handling backend.

---

 Work Completed
Multilingual Support (Vlad & Bianca)
Added support for English, Romanian, French, and Spanish.
Implemented automatic language detection.
Adapted conversational flows per language.

---

AI Algorithm Upgrade (Vlad)
Improved intent detection:
Frequency scoring
Synonym dictionary mapping
Early NER integration
Context retention across turns
Dramatically improved conversational accuracy.

---

API Gateway & Routing (Adrian)
Built centralized API gateway.
Added new endpoints:
/language/detect
/session/history
/analytics/events
Improved batching for lower latency (~30% faster).

---

Conversation Analytics Engine (Dana)
Implemented logging for user intents & actions.
Built heatmap-style analytics for conversation flow.
Added metrics for:
Error rate
Average call length
Intent distribution
Added JSON export system for BDA course analysis.
---

Workflow Automation Logic (Bianca)
Expanded restaurant ordering workflow to support:
Multiple items
Dietary preferences
Delivery vs pickup branching
Designed fallback logic for unclear inputs.

---

Audio Optimization (Augustin)
Improved noise reduction pipeline.
Added silence trimming.
Optimized FFmpeg processing for real-time latency.

---

Load & Stress Testing (Chiril)
Performed stress tests simulating 500+ concurrent calls.
Identified endpoint bottlenecks.
Documented session lock issues and helped resolve them.
Delivered performance graphs and stability reports.

---

 Summary
By the end of Month 2, the system evolved into a stable and scalable AI call center backend featuring:

Multilingual interaction
Accurate context-aware AI engine
Data analytics
Real-time optimized audio pipeline
Load-tested backend services

The project now has a strong foundation for continued development and deployment.
