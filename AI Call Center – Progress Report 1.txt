 Overview (Month 1)
During the first development month, our team built the foundation of the AI Call Center backend system.
We focused on creating the core architecture, backend pipeline, and basic conversational logic.

Main objective:
Build a functional backend prototype capable of handling a simple voice interaction end-to-end.

---

 Work Completed
System Architecture (Vlad & Adrian)
Designed modular backend structure using Python FastAPI.
Defined service boundaries:
Speech-to-Text Service
AI Conversation Engine
Text-to-Speech Service
Call Session Manager
Prepared the system for future scalability.

---

Core Backend Pipeline (Vlad & Adrian)
Implemented /stt, /ai, and /tts endpoints.
Added session-based communication.
Created prototype memory for conversation state.
Built early restaurant-ordering workflow logic.

---

AI Algorithm Research (Vlad)
Designed early intent detection module.
Implemented a response-ranking heuristic.
Explored GPT-based API integration.
Developed keyword-based intent classifier.

---

Audio Processing Pipeline (Augustin)
Added audio normalization and format handling.
Integrated FFmpeg for preprocessing.
Built initial audio input/output handling logic.
---

Dialog Flow Logic (Bianca)
Created first version of dialog state manager.
Built decision tree for restaurant interaction.
Ensured compatibility with intent detection module.

---

Data Models & Validation (Dana)
Built Pydantic models:
CallSession, UserMessage, AIResponse, IntentClassification
Implemented structured error handling.
Ensured data validation on all endpoints.

---

Testing & QA (Chiril)
Implemented automated backend tests.
Performed Postman-based functional tests.
Created bug reports and stability notes.
Validated STT and TTS response consistency.

---

 Summary
By the end of Month 1, we delivered a functional backend prototype capable of handling a full voice interaction in a controlled environment.
Every team member contributed directly to backend development and infrastructure .
